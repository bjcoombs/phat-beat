Stereo amplifier, buttons and dual RGB VU meter for your Pi.

## Installing

### Full install (recommended):

We've created an easy installation script that will install all pre-requisites and get your pHAT BEAT
up and running with minimal efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu -> Accessories -> Terminal
on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated below:

![Finding the terminal](http://get.pimoroni.com/resources/github-repo-terminal.png)

In the new terminal window type the command exactly as it appears below (check for typos) and follow the on-screen instructions:

```bash
curl https://get.pimoroni.com/phatbeat | bash
```

Alternatively, on Raspbian, you can download the `pimoroni-dashboard` and install your product by browsing to the relevant entry:

```bash
sudo apt-get install pimoroni
```
(you will find the Dashboard under 'Accessories' too, in the Pi menu - or just run `pimoroni-dashboard` at the command line)

If you choose to download examples you'll find them in `/home/pi/Pimoroni/phatbeat/`.
